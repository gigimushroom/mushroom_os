**Which registers contain arguments to functions? For example, which register holds 13 in main’s call to printf?**
a0–a7 and fa0-fa7contains function arguments.
a0 is also return values.
13 is stored in register a2

**Where is the function call to f from main? Where is the call to g? (Hint: the compiler may inline functions.)**
Call to f from main
`26:	45b1                	li	a1,12`
Call to g from f
` 14:	250d                	addiw	a0,a0,3`

**At what address is the function printf located?**
`0000000000000650 <printf>`

**What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main?**
`pc+4` is written to register ra.
In our example asm, ra stores 0x38
